# Task 3: Multi-Cloud Architecture

## Abstract
In this task, I built a multi-cloud architecture by integrating AWS S3 and Google Firebase. The static website hosted on S3 sends data to a Firebase Realtime Database via JavaScript fetch API. This task demonstrates real-world interoperability between two cloud providers and highlights the flexibility of distributed cloud applications.

## Files Included
- index.html (frontend code)
- Screenshot of S3 hosting
- Firebase dashboard and rules
- Architecture diagram

## Tools Used
- AWS S3
